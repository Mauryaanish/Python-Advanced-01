Function can't access the attributes of an instance of a class or can't modify the state of the object. A function is independent, whereas a method is a function linked with an object. Explicit data is passed on to a function, whereas a method completely passes the object on which it was called in the program. A method is Object-oriented programming while a function has standalone functionality"

To prevent accidental change, an objects variable can only be changed by an objects method."

        "Answer:- Reflection refers to the ability for code to be able to examine attributes about objects that might be passed as parameters to a function. For example, if we write type(obj) then Python will return an object which represents the type of obj. Using reflection, we can write one recursive reverse function that will work for strings, lists, and any other sequence that supports slicing and concatenation. If an obj is a reference to a string, then Python will return the str type object. Further, if we write str() we get a string which is the empty string. In other words, writing str() is the same thing as writing “”. Likewise, writing list() is the same thing as writing []."
